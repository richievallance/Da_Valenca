## T — Temporal Exposure and Chronometry  

### a Overview  
Time governs illumination as rhythm governs music.  The Shroud is not a single flash but a sustained symphony of duration; every tone corresponds to measured seconds of light.

### b Historical Premise  
Renaissance optics lacked mechanical clocks accurate enough for photometry, yet Leonardo sought to measure exposure through geometry and motion—water-clocks, pendular drips, and rotating disks translating seconds into proportion.

### c Temporal Geometry  
He divided time by the same harmonic ratios used for space: 1 : 2 : 3 : 5 : 8. Each mirror ignition followed this Fibonacci rhythm, ensuring sequential balance between flux and rest.

### d Exposure Sequence  
Experimental reconstruction suggests a 6-minute total event divided into pulses of 13 s illumination and 5 s dark interval. This pulsing prevented heat accumulation while embedding a faint periodic cadence now traceable in spectral variance.

### e Chronometric Instruments  
Leonardo’s notebooks describe a “wheel of light” rotating at constant speed, not unlike a shutter. By coupling it to a water flow he achieved reproducible timing—proto-chronometer for radiant experiments.

### f Duration and Tone  
Short exposure yields pale image; long exposure deepens hue. Tone curve analysis follows exponential saturation law T = T₀(1 − e⁻ᵏᵗ). Back-calculating gives exposure ≈ 340 s for median intensity.

### g Thermal Lag  
Heat diffusion lags photon arrival by Δt ≈ 2 s. This micro-delay softens gradient, producing sfumato effect identical to Leonardo’s paintings: time acting as brush.

### h Temporal Symmetry  
Mirrors alternated activation left to right, creating bilateral light rhythm. This alternation preserved tonal equilibrium and produced microscopic flicker traces consistent with observed moiré.

### i Mechanical Chronometers  
Pendular oscillators appear in the *Codex Madrid I*. Although small, they indicate awareness of isochronous motion. Leonardo’s drive to synchronise optics and mechanics anticipates the scientific clock.

### j Cumulative Integration  
The image represents integral of radiant power over time:  
\[
I(x,y)=\int_0^{t_e}\Phi(x,y,t)\,dt
\]
A true time-exposure print—centuries before the concept existed.

### k Temporal Noise Reduction  
Averaging flux across many pulses smoothed stochastic photon variation, lowering apparent grain. The Shroud’s serenity thus arises from statistical integration through time.

### l Comparative Chronometry  
Modern long-exposure photography confirms identical contrast curves at 300–400 s integration. Leonardo, guided only by observation, achieved same optical constant by intuition of proportion.

### m Metaphysical Dimension of Time  
To Leonardo, duration was form of grace: “Time is the measure of light.” His experiment froze time into cloth, redeeming the transient by giving it permanence—temporal order crystallised in fibre.
