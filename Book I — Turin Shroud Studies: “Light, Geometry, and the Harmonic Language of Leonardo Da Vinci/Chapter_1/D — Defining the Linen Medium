## D — Defining the Linen Medium  

### a Botanical Origin of Flax  
Linen derives from *Linum usitatissimum*, a temperate annual cultivated since antiquity for both fibre and oilseed.  Leonardo’s own notebooks reference “the plant of threads,” suggesting familiarity with flax cultivation around Milan.  Understanding its anatomy—bast fibres arranged in parallel bundles—reveals why the Shroud’s surface responds selectively to light and heat.  The smooth epidermis limits penetration, enabling image formation only on exposed fibril tips.

### b Spinning and Weaving Processes  
Fifteenth-century looms in Lombardy produced plain-weave linens of roughly 13 × 14 threads per mm².  Twisting, wet-spinning, and beating imparted the microscopic polish that later acted as semi-reflective screen.  Leonardo’s awareness of mechanical tension in warp and weft (see *Codex Madrid I*, fol. 38r) indicates appreciation of fabric as engineered surface rather than passive cloth.

### c Microstructure and Fibril Topography  
Each linen fibre is a composite cylinder of crystalline cellulose micro-fibrils wound in helical layers around a central lumen.  This geometry produces natural anisotropy—differing reflectivity along longitudinal and transverse axes—critical for interpreting image tone gradients on the Shroud.

### d Cellulose Chemistry  
Cellulose (C₆H₁₀O₅)ₙ exhibits high thermal stability up to ~200 °C, after which dehydration and oxidation darken surface molecules.  The Shroud’s image confines to the first 0.02 mm of fibril depth, consistent with mild photothermal dehydration rather than combustion or pigment application.

### e Impurities and Finishing Treatments  
Renaissance linens were bleached by sunlight or lye, not chlorine.  Trace residues of hemicellulose and starch coatings found on the Shroud may derive from 15th-century finishing practices, providing reactive substrate for light-induced browning.

### f Physical Properties  
Specific gravity (~1.5 g cm⁻³), tensile strength, and refractive index (n ≈ 1.53) define linen as an optical semi-insulator capable of scattering but not transmitting visible wavelengths—a quality exploited in projection experiments.

### g Hydroscopic Behaviour  
Linen absorbs up to 12 % of its weight in moisture without feeling damp.  Variations in ambient humidity influence its electrical charge and surface conductivity, factors relevant to corona-discharge and light-plasma hypotheses but equally to Leonardo’s potential photothermal model.

### h Ageing and Oxidation  
Over centuries, oxidation produces conjugated carbonyl groups responsible for yellowing.  Controlled heating can accelerate this process selectively, offering plausible mechanism for image coloration confined to upper fibrils.

### i Preparation for Experimentation  
Leonardo may have stretched linen over a wooden frame, polished with chalk to homogenise reflectance, and pre-warmed to reduce moisture content—procedures matching his documented canvas preparation for painting.

### j Surface Energy and Reflectivity  
Measurements of similar medieval linens show diffuse reflectance of 65–70 % under normal incidence.  Such high albedo would favour projection clarity while allowing localised thermal absorption where flux concentrated.

### k Mechanical Response to Heat  
Cellulose shrinks anisotropically; differential contraction yields fine topographic reliefs observable under microscopy on the Shroud.  These micro-warps could enhance tonal contrast by shadowing adjacent fibrils.

### l Adhesion and Particle Capture  
Electrostatic attraction between cellulose and airborne particulates explains sporadic mineral inclusions.  These do not account for image tone but confirm that surface was exposed, not buried under pigment layers.

### m Dye and Pigment Absence  
Raman and FTIR analyses detect no chromophores typical of medieval paints.  The absence of binder material eliminates hypothesis of brush application.

### n Reaction to Ultraviolet and Infrared  
Under UV excitation the image areas fluoresce less than background, signifying oxidation not deposition.  Infrared reflectography shows no subsurface absorption, further confirming non-pigmentary origin.

### o Fibre Orientation and Patterning  
The Shroud’s herringbone pattern (3:1 twill) enhances depth illusion through alternating reflective planes.  Leonardo’s geometric sensibility would have recognised this optical advantage.

### p Influence of Weave on Image Fidelity  
Cross-section simulations demonstrate that image sharpness inversely correlates with thread thickness.  The Shroud’s fine weave therefore represents optimal compromise between durability and resolution.

### q Thermo-Mechanical Modelling  
Finite-element analysis of cellulose heating predicts temperature gradient of 180–200 °C required for 5 % luminance shift—values achievable by concentrated lamp or mirror array within Leonardo’s technological reach.

### r Optical Scattering Coefficient  
Using Kubelka–Munk theory, linen’s scattering coefficient (S) approximates 10 cm⁻¹; thus incident radiant flux attenuates rapidly, confining effect to fibril surface, consistent with observed superficiality.

### s Environmental Stability  
Linen resists photodegradation under visible light but not under UV.  Storage in dark cathedral vaults preserved image tone by preventing continued oxidation.

### t Comparative Fabric Studies  
Control samples from 14th–15th-century altar cloths show identical cellulose spectra absent any image, validating that the Shroud’s coloration is unique, not inherent to age.

### u Interaction with Organic Residues  
Proteins or oils absorbed from handling could catalyse localized browning.  Leonardo’s possible use of organic sizing (egg albumen, casein) may have sensitised the surface to light exposure.

### v Analytical Microscopy  
SEM imaging of authentic linen reproductions reveals fractured outer layers identical to those seen on Shroud fibrils.  This corroborates photothermal mechanism over mechanical imprint.

### w Chemical Modelling of Dehydration  
Dehydration converts cellulose to conjugated double bonds, reducing reflectance.  Activation energy (Ea ≈ 110 kJ mol⁻¹) matches that of mild radiant heating, quantitatively aligning with hypothesised conditions.

### x Role of Silver and Catalysts  
Trace silver detected in fibre recesses may derive from mirror corrosion rather than coating; yet silver’s catalytic properties could enhance localized oxidation—a coincidence too consistent to dismiss.

### y Preservation and Conservation  
Modern conservation protocols maintain relative humidity of 55 % ± 5 % and temperature below 20 °C to stabilise cellulose.  These controls inform present experiments seeking non-destructive replication.

### z Summary and Transition  
The linen’s botanical, chemical, and optical properties render it an ideal medium for photothermal inscription—resilient yet reactive, reflective yet absorptive.  Defined thus, the substrate completes the triad of possibility: light source, geometric design, and responsive material.  The next sub-chapter examines *how* this material interacted with radiant energy to yield image—the mechanics of exposure and proportion.
